The original code is for "A Dual-Attention Network for Joint Named Entity Recognition and Sentence Classification of Adverse Drug Events", Findings of EMNLP, 2020. In this work, we use and adapt the code for evaluation.

Data format
-------------------------
The training, dev and test data is expected in standard CoNLL-type tab-separated format. One word per line, separate column for token and label, empty line between sentences.

Multi-class classification: Make sure there is a file "tags.txt" with all the tags in the dataset. The tags should in in order.

Any word with *default_label* gets label 0, any word with other labels that are in the tags.txt file gets assigned an integer i, where i is the row #. Labels are expected to be in order.

Any sentence that contains words which have only *default_label* and/or nonADE labels is assigned a sentence-level label 0, any sentence containing words that have drug related "ADE" label gets assigned 1.


Run experiment with 

    python experiment.py config_file.conf

Code adapted from "Marek Rei and Anders SÃ¸gaard. Jointly learning to label sentences and tokens. AAAI 2019", for binary classification of words and sentences with a single type of attention from the words/entities.
